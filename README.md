# angularjs-app
## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `angularjs-app` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js and tools (`npm`, `bower`,...)

### Clone app-template

Clone the `angularjs-app` repository using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/at-dongvd/angularjs-app.git
cd angularjs-app
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code.  The tools help us manage and test the application.

- We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`.
- We get the Angular code via `bower`.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```bash
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new folders in your project.

- `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
- `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

_Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but `app-template` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes it easier to serve the files by a webserver._

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start this server is:

```bash
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
